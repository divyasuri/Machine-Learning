# MachineLearningProjects
This contains all my submissions for my Machine Learning class I took in the Spring of 2019. These were explorations of different supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, some involve the use of Python packages (like Scikit Learn), others show a step-by-step implementation of the technique to better understand the math behind these complex algorithms.
