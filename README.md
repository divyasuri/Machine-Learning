# Machine Learning Projects

Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn)

This contains my submissions for INF552: Machine Learning for Data Informatics. These were explorations of different supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, some involve the use of Python packages (like Scikit Learn), others show a step-by-step implementation of the technique to better understand the math behind these complex algorithms.
